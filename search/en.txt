{"$":"/en/about/index","t":"ABOUT US","c":"ESSENCE NOMAD GURU is a dynamic musical collaboration that takes many forms. As a music project, we blend the sonic codes of various cultures and ethnicities into unique soundscapes. As a community, we gather spiritual seekers and teachers. As an art space, we provide a platform for creative live collaborations. We are flexible in our work and committed in our friendships STORY The NOMAD GURU project emerged in early 2018 at the meeting of three musical shamans, three creative forces, three 'dharma wanderers' - Nata, Dan and Max. \n The idea of 'live creation' that sparked the project became the centrepiece of our first album 'Tones of Mind', released in 2019, and the motto for all of our following activities. \n In 2020, the single \"Holody\" (Cold Times) marked a new period in the history of NOMAD GURU - a time of change, when we grew beyond the definition of a music band. We sprouted a vibrant community, started holding workshops, retreats, and even a little craft fair of our own. \n2021 was a year of development and transformation of the project. The changes which had begun the year before took shape as three separate directions - NOMAD GURU (the band), GURU SCHOOL and GURU HOUSE/SPACE. By the end of 2021, we have also finished the pre-production of our new concept album, The Way.\n CREATE NOMAD GURU is best described as \"music of mind states\", combining deep electronic bassline, piercing female vocals and raw force of live ethnic instruments from all around the world. Born in improvisation, NOMAD GURU's music is a manifesto of pure being, the philosphy of 'here-and-now'\n ALBUMS #TONESOFMIND / 2019 / Deep Tribal Shaman House #THEWAY / 2020 - present / Deep Organic Techno - Downtempo - SHAMAN CHILL SINGLES - #HOLODY #SATKARTAR #NOMADGURUECSTATIC - DJ sets for body and spirit.

{"$":"/en/art/theway/river-in-me","t":"RIVER IN ME","c":"The time for searching and waiting has passed. The endless chase, chaotic and restless like the breathing of a rabid horse, has finally ended. It's not even been a chase - rather, an agony of mind.\nNow the caterpillar is ready to shed its cocoon, and see the world again, as a butterfly. \nThe train of habits is a heavy, clumsy juggernaut.  Takes a loooong while to stop. When you think that you've reached full awareness, the point when you fully inhabit yourself, another curtain of illusion falls - and you notice something else is pulling you sideways, mechanically, along your usual tracks. \n But now the chase is over, so I slow down my pace. I take a deep breath, and stop. I'm finally at the river's source. Here, nothing matters anymore, besides me and the source. Just the two of us. That's all I need to know now. There's me. And there's the river. \n The world freezes still, without ceasing its motion. Colors change, faces change, but the river is constant in its perpetual flow.\n There is always a choice - sit by the shore, gazing at the water, keep looking for enlightenment, listen to the great river and wait, or, finally, become the river and just... be. Be whatever you like - a roaring mountain torrent, or a huge mass of water flowing calmly through endless plains. Be what you had been a million cycles ago. \n Thus I carry on, lifting myself higher in search for the greater meaning, then diving back into life, with its everyday routine, work, parties until sunrise, and then taking some time to simply rest on a couch, cuddle with my daughter and my cats. \n I fall in life, my simple life, my only life. But now at lat it feels so damn... alive. With its incredible music, wonderful places, vibrant people. Is this the real life, or is it just fantasy? I don't know. Nor do I care. Illusion or reality, up or down. It's beyond good and evil, beyond right and wrong. Turns out you just have to live with your mind switched off, just like Forrest Gump did. Remember? The guy just lived his life as it happened - and met it with joy.\nHe was just happy to be alive. And this is how I've come to feel about life, too. Go with the flow. Be the river.\nJust be.\n "}

{"$":"/en/art/theway/sat-kar-tar","t":"Sat Kar Tar","c":"You're living in a constant chase. The world has gone insane, and now it zooms towards you at a supersonic pace, bombarding you with circumstances, news, events, while keeping a keen eye on your reaction. What would it be? Would you retreat? Hide? Meet it all head on? Whatever course of action you choose to take, it will all mean resistance. Because, if you surrender, give in to roaring torrents of life, you will be washed away, you'll drown and perish - at least, so say the instincts.\nAnd instincts can't be wrong...\n But hey, what if they are?\n You stop to take a breath, and listen to the silence. Then, suddenly, you hear - and utter -\n Sat Kar Tar\n An ancient mantra, whose meaning eludes the Pharisees, and yet sounds crystal clear to those who seek the truth in Spirit\n Sat Kar Tar\nGod Is\n And all there is, all that is manifested, is His will. If you let go of your resistance and accept it all with faith - you'll see reality unfold before you, pure and simple. The jigsaw pieces will align.\n Sat Kar Tar\nThe Maker Is The Truth\n Open your heart, and let it lead you. Let this understanding soothe your pain. Observe the beauty, the brilliance of His design.\n Sat Kar Tar\nAll Is One\n What was disparate now stands united, inseparable, intertwined. The flap of a moth's wing may cause a storm, a casual smile can one day save the world.\n Sat Kar Tar\nHis Will Be Done\n The words that have brought consolation to the losers and tempered the fervor of those who won, remind us: nothing lasts forever. All of our trifles are minute\n It's simple:\n The Water flows,\nThe Wind blows,\nThe Fire burns,\nThe Earth bears fruit\n Right now, let go of all your worries, put the world on hold, and whisper:\n Sat Kar Tar\n When to listen? When you lose faith. When fear takes over and you lack the strength to make a move. When you're recovering from an illness. In a personal crisis, or during mood swings. When you lose balance.\n How to listen? In peace. With your morning cup of coffee or tea, while the world around is still waking up. In the afternoon, to reboot yourself after a hard day, to leave your work at work. Listen with your heart, let the music inside your body. Feel the beat in your veins. Immerse yourself in it.\n Meditation: Sit in Easy Pose. Close your eyes, focus on the point between your eyebrows. \n Mantra: SAT KAR TAR \n As you say SAT, the hands are pressed together in Prayer Pose at the center of the chest.\n As you say KAR, the hands are extended out from the shoulders half-way towards the final position. Fingers are pointing straight up.\n As you say TAR, the arms are fully extended out to the sides and parallel to the floor with the fingers pointing up.\n Make the transition from step to step a flowing movement.\n "}
