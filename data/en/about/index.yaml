    - h2: ESSENCE
    - p: NOMAD GURU is a dynamic musical collaboration that takes many forms. As a music project, we blend the sonic codes of various cultures and ethnicities into unique soundscapes. As a community, we gather spiritual seekers and teachers. As an art space, we provide a platform for creative live collaborations. We are flexible in our work and committed in our friendships 

    - h2: STORY
    - p: |
        The NOMAD GURU project emerged in early 2018 at the meeting of three musical shamans, three creative forces, three 'dharma wanderers' - Nata, Dan and Max. 
    - p: |
        The idea of 'live creation' that sparked the project became the centrepiece of our first album 'Tones of Mind', released in 2019, and the motto for all of our following activities. 
    - p: |
        In 2020, the single "Holody" (Cold Times) marked a new period in the history of NOMAD GURU - a time of change, when we grew beyond the definition of a music band. We sprouted a vibrant community, started holding workshops, retreats, and even a little craft fair of our own. 
        2021 was a year of development and transformation of the project. The changes which had begun the year before took shape as three separate directions - NOMAD GURU (the band), GURU SCHOOL and GURU HOUSE/SPACE. By the end of 2021, we have also finished the pre-production of our new concept album, The Way.

    - p: |
        NOMAD GURU is best described as "music of mind states", combining deep electronic bassline, piercing female vocals and raw force of live ethnic instruments from all around the world. Born in improvisation, NOMAD GURU's music is a manifesto of pure being, the philosphy of 'here-and-now'
