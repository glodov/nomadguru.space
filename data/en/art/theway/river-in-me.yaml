        The time for searching and waiting has passed. The endless chase, chaotic and restless like the breathing of a rabid horse, has finally ended. It's not even been a chase - rather, an agony of mind.
        Now the caterpillar is ready to shed its cocoon, and see the world again, as a butterfly. 
        The train of habits is a heavy, clumsy juggernaut.  Takes a loooong while to stop. When you think that you've reached full awareness, the point when you fully inhabit yourself, another curtain of illusion falls - and you notice something else is pulling you sideways, mechanically, along your usual tracks.

        But now the chase is over, so I slow down my pace. I take a deep breath, and stop. I'm finally at the river's source. Here, nothing matters anymore, besides me and the source. Just the two of us. That's all I need to know now. There's me. And there's the river.

        The world freezes still, without ceasing its motion. Colors change, faces change, but the river is constant in its perpetual flow.

        There is always a choice - sit by the shore, gazing at the water, keep looking for enlightenment, listen to the great river and wait, or, finally, become the river and just... be. Be whatever you like - a roaring mountain torrent, or a huge mass of water flowing calmly through endless plains. Be what you had been a million cycles ago.

        Thus I carry on, lifting myself higher in search for the greater meaning, then diving back into life, with its everyday routine, work, parties until sunrise, and then taking some time to simply rest on a couch, cuddle with my daughter and my cats.

        I fall in life, my simple life, my only life. But now at lat it feels so damn... alive. With its incredible music, wonderful places, vibrant people. Is this the real life, or is it just fantasy? I don't know. Nor do I care. Illusion or reality, up or down. It's beyond good and evil, beyond right and wrong. Turns out you just have to live with your mind switched off, just like Forrest Gump did. Remember? The guy just lived his life as it happened - and met it with joy.
        He was just happy to be alive. And this is how I've come to feel about life, too. Go with the flow. Be the river.
        Just be.
