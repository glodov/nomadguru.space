        You're living in a constant chase. The world has gone insane, and now it zooms towards you at a supersonic pace, bombarding you with circumstances, news, events, while keeping a keen eye on your reaction. What would it be? Would you retreat? Hide? Meet it all head on? Whatever course of action you choose to take, it will all mean resistance. Because, if you surrender, give in to roaring torrents of life, you will be washed away, you'll drown and perish - at least, so say the instincts.
        And instincts can't be wrong...

        But hey, what if they are?
    - p: |
        You stop to take a breath, and listen to the silence. Then, suddenly, you hear - and utter -
    - p: |
        Sat Kar Tar
    - p: |
        An ancient mantra, whose meaning eludes the Pharisees, and yet sounds crystal clear to those who seek the truth in Spirit
    - p: |
        Sat Kar Tar
        God Is
    - p: |
        And all there is, all that is manifested, is His will. If you let go of your resistance and accept it all with faith - you'll see reality unfold before you, pure and simple. The jigsaw pieces will align.
    - p: |
        Sat Kar Tar
        The Maker Is The Truth
    - p: |
        Open your heart, and let it lead you. Let this understanding soothe your pain. Observe the beauty, the brilliance of His design.
    - p: |
        Sat Kar Tar
        All Is One
    - p: |
        What was disparate now stands united, inseparable, intertwined. The flap of a moth's wing may cause a storm, a casual smile can one day save the world.
    - p: |
        Sat Kar Tar
        His Will Be Done
    - p: |
        The words that have brought consolation to the losers and tempered the fervor of those who won, remind us: nothing lasts forever. All of our trifles are minute
    - p: |
        It's simple:
    - p: |
        The Water flows,
        The Wind blows,
        The Fire burns,
        The Earth bears fruit
    - p: |
        Right now, let go of all your worries, put the world on hold, and whisper:
    - p: |
        Sat Kar Tar

    - h2: When to listen?
    - p: |
        When you lose faith. When fear takes over and you lack the strength to make a move. When you're recovering from an illness. In a personal crisis, or during mood swings. When you lose balance.

    - h2: How to listen?
    - p: |
        In peace. With your morning cup of coffee or tea, while the world around is still waking up. In the afternoon, to reboot yourself after a hard day, to leave your work at work. Listen with your heart, let the music inside your body. Feel the beat in your veins. Immerse yourself in it.

    - h2: 'Meditation:'
    - p: |
        Sit in Easy Pose. Close your eyes, focus on the point between your eyebrows.

        Mantra: SAT KAR TAR 
    - p: |
        As you say SAT, the hands are pressed together in Prayer Pose at the center of the chest.
    - p: |
        As you say KAR, the hands are extended out from the shoulders half-way towards the final position. Fingers are pointing straight up.
    - p: |
        As you say TAR, the arms are fully extended out to the sides and parallel to the floor with the fingers pointing up.
    - p: |
        Make the transition from step to step a flowing movement.
